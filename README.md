## Frontend Overview

The frontend of the Morphle Full Stack App is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It serves as the user-facing interface for interacting with the Morphle Scanner. The frontend provides a seamless and intuitive experience, allowing users to navigate and capture images from microscope slides with ease.

## Key Features

Interactive Grid: A 20x60 grid representation of the microscope slide enables users to visually select regions for capturing images.
Real-time Feedback: The grid dynamically updates to indicate focused, captured, and untouched regions, providing immediate visual feedback.
Arrow Key Navigation: Users can use keyboard arrow keys to move the camera's focus, enhancing navigation efficiency.
Technologies Used
React.js: A powerful JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling and customizing the appearance of the grid and its elements.
