## Frontend Overview

The frontend of the Morphle Full Stack App is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It serves as the user-facing interface for interacting with the Morphle Scanner. The frontend provides a seamless and intuitive experience, allowing users to navigate and capture images from microscope slides with ease.

## Key Features

Interactive Grid: A 20x60 grid representation of the microscope slide enables users to visually select regions for capturing images.
Real-time Feedback: The grid dynamically updates to indicate focused, captured, and untouched regions, providing immediate visual feedback.
Arrow Key Navigation: Users can use keyboard arrow keys to move the camera's focus, enhancing navigation efficiency.
Technologies Used
React.js: A powerful JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling and customizing the appearance of the grid and its elements.

# Matrix/Grid Color Legend

- **Current Cell**:
  - Represented by a **red border**. This indicates the cell that is currently selected or in focus.

- **Unvisited**:
  - Displayed in **grey**. These cells have not been interacted with or observed.

- **Visited (Not Focused/Captured)**:
  - Displayed in **yellow**. These cells have been visited, but no specific action (focus or capture) has been performed on them.

- **Focusing**:
  - Displayed in **light blue**. This indicates that the camera is in the process of focusing on this cell.

- **Focused**:
  - Displayed in **dark blue**. This indicates that the camera has successfully focused on this cell and is ready for capture.

- **Capturing**:
  - Displayed in **light green**. This signifies that the camera is currently capturing an image of this cell.

- **Captured**:
  - Displayed in **dark green**. This indicates that the camera has successfully captured an image of this cell.

This color legend provides a visual reference for the different states and actions associated with cells in the grid, enhancing user understanding and interaction with the Morphle Scanner application.

# Improvements

## Frontend

- **Polling for Real-time Updates**:
    - The current implementation relies on periodic polling to obtain the latest state of the scanner matrix and current cell position. This introduces network overhead and may not be the most efficient approach for real-time updates.

- **Network Overhead**:
    - Polling frequently can lead to increased network traffic and potential delays in fetching updated data. This may impact the responsiveness of the application.

- **WebSocket for Real-time Communication**:
    - To address these concerns, implementing a WebSocket-based connection between the frontend and backend could significantly improve efficiency. WebSockets allow for bi-directional, low-latency communication, reducing the need for frequent polling.

## Backend

- **Async Logic for Camera Control**:
    - The current backend logic for controlling the camera relies on an asynchronous function that continuously checks for changes in the camera position. While functional, this approach may not be the most efficient and could potentially lead to unnecessary processing.

- **Queue-Based Approach**:
    - An alternative approach could involve implementing a queue-based system where each keystroke is added to a queue and processed later based on its priority. This could lead to more streamlined and efficient handling of camera operations.

- **Optimizing Camera Operations**:
    - Further optimization of camera operations, such as intelligent prioritization of focus and capture tasks, could enhance the overall performance of the application.

These proposed improvements aim to address the identified weaknesses in both the frontend and backend components of the Morphle Full Stack App. By implementing these enhancements, the application can achieve higher efficiency, reduced network overhead, and improved real-time responsiveness.
